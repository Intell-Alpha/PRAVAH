  - Use regular expressions or NLP to extract relevant data.

### Data Validation:
- **Endpoint:** `/validate`
- **Functionality:**
  - Compare extracted data across documents for consistency.
  - Validate data against external databases (if accessible) or use predefined rules.
  - Optionally, verify data with additional checks (e.g., institutional verification).

**Tools:**
- Regex: For pattern matching.
- spaCy: For NLP-based text parsing.

## 5. Facial Recognition (Optional)

### Facial Matching:
- **Endpoint:** `/facial-recognition`
- **Functionality:**
  - Compare facial images from documents to validate identity.
  - Return results indicating whether faces match or not.

**Tools:**
- Face_recognition: For facial recognition tasks.

---

## 6. Document Verification Workflow

### Verification Management:
- **Endpoint:** `/verification`
- **Functionality:**
  - Manage and track the status of document verifications (e.g., pending, verified, rejected).
  - Provide status updates and detailed information to users.

**Tools:**
- Celery: For background tasks and workflow management.
- Redis/RabbitMQ: For task queuing.

---

## 7. API Endpoints for Integration

### REST API:
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/register` - User registration.
  - `/login` - User authentication.
  - `/upload` - Document upload.
  - `/ocr` - OCR processing.
  - `/parse` - Data parsing and extraction.
  - `/validate` - Data validation.
  - `/facial-recognition` - Facial recognition (if applicable).
  - `/verification` - Verification status management.

**Tools:**
- Flask/Django REST Framework: For building RESTful APIs.
- Swagger/OpenAPI: For API documentation.

---

## 8. Security and Compliance

### Security Measures:
- **Data Encryption:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control:**
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles.
- **Compliance:**
  - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) for handling personal data.

**Tools:**
- SSL/TLS: For securing data in transit.
- Encryption Libraries: For encrypting data at rest.

  - Log application events, errors, and user activities.
  - Store logs for auditing and troubleshooting.

### Monitoring:
- **Functionality:**
  - Monitor application performance and health.
  - Set up alerts for critical issues and performance bottlenecks.

**Tools:**
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For logging and visualization.
- Prometheus/Grafana: For monitoring and alerting.

---

## 10. Testing and Deployment

### Testing:
- **Functionality:**
