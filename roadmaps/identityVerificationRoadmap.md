# Document Verification Process

## Step 1: Gather and Preprocess Documents

### Document Collection:
- Obtain sample images or PDFs of identity documents (e.g., driver’s license, Aadhaar card, passport).
- Ensure a diverse set, including different formats, resolutions, and languages.

### Preprocessing:
- **Image Cleaning:** Use techniques like noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and resizing to improve OCR accuracy.
- **Cropping & Alignment:** If needed, crop and align the document images to focus on the areas containing text.

**Tools:**
- OpenCV: For image preprocessing tasks.

---

## Step 2: Implement OCR to Extract Text

### Text Extraction:
- Use OCR to extract key information from the documents, such as name, date of birth, document number, address, etc.

**Example:**

```python
import cv2
import pytesseract

# Load image
image = cv2.imread('license.jpg')

# Preprocess image (e.g., grayscale, thresholding)
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]

# Apply OCR
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(thresh)

print(text)
```

**Tools:**
- Tesseract OCR: An open-source OCR engine.
- Google Cloud Vision: Offers more advanced OCR capabilities, including support for multiple languages.

---

## Step 3: Extract and Structure Key Information

### Text Parsing:
- Use regular expressions or NLP techniques to extract structured data (e.g., name, date of birth, document number) from the OCR output.

**Example:**

```python
import re

# Example OCR output
ocr_text = """
Name: John Doe
DOB: 01/01/1990
License No: XYZ123456
"""

# Extract key information using regex
name = re.search(r'Name:\s*(.*)', ocr_text).group(1)
dob = re.search(r'DOB:\s*(.*)', ocr_text).group(1)
license_no = re.search(r'License No:\s*(.*)', ocr_text).group(1)

print(f"Name: {name}, DOB: {dob}, License No: {license_no}")

```


**Tools:**
- Regex: For pattern matching and text extraction.
- spaCy: For more complex text parsing using NLP.

---

## Step 4: Cross-Validation of Documents

### Consistency Check:
- Compare extracted details from the two documents (e.g., name and date of birth should match across both documents).

**Example:**

```python
def validate_identity(doc1_data, doc2_data):
    if doc1_data['name'] == doc2_data['name'] and doc1_data['dob'] == doc2_data['dob']:
        return True
    return False

```


---

## Step 5: Optional - Facial Recognition for Additional Validation

### Facial Matching:
- If the documents contain photos, use facial recognition to ensure the person’s identity matches across the documents.

**Example:**

```python

import face_recognition

# Load the images
image1 = face_recognition.load_image_file("passport_photo.jpg")
image2 = face_recognition.load_image_file("license_photo.jpg")

# Get the face encodings
face_encoding1 = face_recognition.face_encodings(image1)[0]
face_encoding2 = face_recognition.face_encodings(image2)[0]

# Compare the faces
results = face_recognition.compare_faces([face_encoding1], face_encoding2)

if results[0]:
    print("Faces match")
else:
    print("Faces do not match")

```


**Tools:**
- Face_recognition: A Python library for facial recognition tasks.

---

## Step 6: Develop a User Interface (UI) for Document Upload

### Frontend Development:
- Create a simple web form where users can upload their identity documents.
- Allow users to upload at least two documents for cross-verification.

**Tools:**
- Flask/Django: For building a backend with Python.
- React/Vue.js: For building a user-friendly front-end.

---

## Step 7: Test and Refine the System

### Testing:
- Test the system with a variety of document types, resolutions, and languages to ensure robustness.
- Evaluate the accuracy of OCR and facial recognition.

### Refinement:
- Fine-tune the OCR and facial recognition models based on the test results.
- Implement error handling for cases where documents do not match.

---

## Next Steps
- **Prototype Development:** Start with a small prototype to test OCR and cross-validation functionality.
- **Model Training:** Gather more data to improve OCR accuracy, especially for diverse document types.
- **Integration:** Once the identity verification module is tested and refined, integrate it with the rest of the system (education and experience verification).
