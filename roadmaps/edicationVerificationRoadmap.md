# Education Verification Process

## Step 1: Gather and Preprocess Education Documents

### Document Collection:
- Obtain recent educational transcripts from users (e.g., high school, undergraduate, postgraduate).
- Ensure a diverse set of documents, including different formats, institutions, and languages.

### Preprocessing:
- **Image Cleaning:** Use techniques like noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and resizing to improve OCR accuracy if the transcripts are scanned images.
- **Document Alignment:** If needed, align the document images to focus on the areas containing text.

**Tools:**
- OpenCV: For image preprocessing tasks.

## Step 2: Implement OCR to Extract Text

### Text Extraction:
- Use OCR to extract key information from the transcripts, such as institution name, course titles, grades, and dates of attendance.

**Tools:**
- Tesseract OCR: An open-source OCR engine.
- Google Cloud Vision: Offers advanced OCR capabilities, including support for multiple languages.

## Step 3: Extract and Structure Key Information

### Text Parsing:
- Use regular expressions or NLP techniques to extract structured data (e.g., institution name, course titles, grades) from the OCR output.

**Tools:**
- Regex: For pattern matching and text extraction.
- spaCy: For more complex text parsing using NLP.

---

## Step 4: Validate Educational Data

### Data Validation:
- Cross-check the extracted data with the institution's records (if accessible) to ensure accuracy.
- Use an AI model to detect anomalies (e.g., forged signatures, inconsistent grades).
- Optionally, verify the institution’s accreditation status to ensure it is a recognized educational body.

---

## Step 5: Optional - Institution Verification

### Institution Verification:
- If feasible, directly contact the institution to confirm the authenticity of the transcripts and the individual’s enrollment or graduation status.

**Tools:**
- Verification APIs: If available, for institution data.

---

## Step 6: Develop a User Interface (UI) for Document Upload

### Frontend Development:
- Create a simple web form where users can upload their educational transcripts.
- Allow users to upload multiple transcripts for thorough verification.

**Tools:**
- Flask/Django: For building a backend with Python.
- React/Vue.js: For building a user-friendly front-end.

---

## Step 7: Test and Refine the System

### Testing:
- Test the system with a variety of educational documents, formats, and languages to ensure robustness.
- Evaluate the accuracy of OCR and data validation.

### Refinement:
- Fine-tune the OCR and validation models based on test results.
- Implement error handling for cases where documents cannot be verified.

---

## Next Steps
- **Prototype Development:** Start with a small prototype to test OCR and data validation functionality.
- **Model Training:** Gather more educational document samples to improve OCR accuracy and validation processes.
- **Integration:** Once the education verification module is tested and refined, integrate it with the rest of the system (identity and experience verification).
