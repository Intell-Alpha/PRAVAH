# Document Verification Plan

Great, dividing the verification into these three parts is a logical approach. Here's how we can tackle each component:

## 1. Identity Verification

**Objective:** Verify the individual’s identity using at least two government-issued documents.

**Steps:**

- **Document Collection:**
  - Require users to upload at least two of the following: driver's license, Aadhaar card, passport, voter ID, etc.
  
- **OCR and Data Extraction:**
  - Use OCR to extract key information from these documents, such as name, date of birth, address, and unique ID numbers.

- **Cross-Validation:**
  - Compare the extracted details across the two documents to ensure consistency (e.g., names and dates of birth should match).
  - Optionally, match the data against government databases (if accessible) for additional validation.

- **Facial Recognition (Optional but recommended):**
  - If documents like passports or Aadhaar cards include a photo, use facial recognition to match the individual’s live or stored image with the one on the documents.

**Tools:**

- OCR: Google Cloud Vision, Tesseract.
- Facial Recognition: Face_recognition, Dlib.

## 2. Education Verification

**Objective:** Verify the individual's educational background using recent transcripts.

**Steps:**

- **Document Collection:**
  - Require users to upload their most recent transcripts (e.g., high school, undergraduate, or postgraduate).

- **OCR and Data Extraction:**
  - Extract details like institution name, course title, grades, and dates of attendance from the transcripts.

- **Validation:**
  - Cross-check the extracted data with the institution's records (if accessible) or use an AI model to detect anomalies (e.g., forged logos, signatures).
  - Optionally, verify the institution's accreditation status to ensure it’s a recognized body.

**Tools:**

- OCR: Google Cloud Vision, Tesseract.
- NLP/Pattern Recognition: spaCy, TensorFlow/PyTorch for anomaly detection.

## 3. Experience Verification

**Objective:** Verify the individual’s recent work experience and ensure it aligns with the current role.

**Steps:**

- **Document Collection:**
  - Require users to upload experience letters, employment contracts, or references from recent employers.

- **OCR and Data Extraction:**
  - Extract information such as company name, job title, duration of employment, and roles/responsibilities.

- **Validation:**
  - Cross-check the extracted information with the employer's official records (if accessible) or use AI to detect anomalies in the documents.
  - Match the job roles/responsibilities with the requirements of the current role to determine if the experience is relevant.
  - Optionally, contact previous employers directly for additional verification.

**Tools:**

- OCR: Google Cloud Vision, Tesseract.
- NLP: For matching job descriptions with current role requirements.
- Pattern Recognition: For detecting inconsistencies in experience letters.

## Integration

- **Centralized Portal:**
  - Develop a centralized portal where users can upload documents for identity, education, and experience verification.

- **AI Backend:**
  - Build a backend system that processes these documents through OCR, NLP, and pattern recognition models.

- **Blockchain (Optional):**
  - Store verified documents on a blockchain for added security and immutability.

## Next Steps

- **Prototype Development:**
  - Start by developing a basic prototype that handles document upload and OCR for each verification part.

- **AI Model Training:**
  - Gather datasets for training AI models for each verification component.

- **Testing and Refinement:**
  - Test the prototype with real or simulated documents and refine the AI models for accuracy.

- **Integration:**
  - Integrate the verification components into a cohesive platform.
